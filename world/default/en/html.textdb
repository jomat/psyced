|<dt><p><b> /h(elp) </b></p><dd>
|shows a short list of commands.
|
|<a name="bye"></a>
|<dt><P><B> /bye </B></p><dd>
|closes the chat window and saves the user data.
|People in the room see that you are leaving on purpose,
|instead of seeing messages of temporary unavailability.
|Please do use this command to leave the chat.
|
|</dl>
|{_HTML_info_split}

|
|<a name="tell"></a>
|<dt><p><b> /t(ell) &lt;person&gt; &lt;message&gt; </b></p><dd>
|sends a single message directly to the person. The recipient
|doesn't need to be in the same room.
|
|<a name="talk"></a>
|<DT><p><b> /t(alk) &lt;name&gt; </b> and <b> /t(alk) </b></p><dd>
|enters the dialogue mode which sends all of your input to the
|named person, not to the current room. You can still talk to the
|room by typing <nobr>"<b>/ &lt;text&gt;</b>"</nobr>, in other
|words, by prefixing your input with a slash and a space.
|"<b>/q</b>" terminates this dialogue mode.
|
|<a name="me"></a>
|<dt><p><b> /me &lt;description&gt; </b></p><dd>
|shows an action description. <nobr>"<b>/me smiles</b>"</nobr>
|for instance produces the message <nobr><em>"JoeCool smiles."</em></nobr>
|
|<dt><p><b> /&lt;your nickname&gt; &lt;description&gt; </b></p><dd>
|sets such an action description permanently. It will appear

|<DT><P><B> /set filter [ s(trangers) | off | d(efault) ]</B></p><dd>
|permits you to disable private messages from strangers.
|Only friends which are marked for notification using <b>/friend</b>
|will be allowed to talk to you privately. Others will have to
|wait to meet you in a room. "<b>default</b>" resets this value to
|the local default.
|
|</dl>

|offers friendship to a person. Should this friendship be acknowledged from
|the other side, then you will in future receive presence updates on the
|other person's availability. Additionally this function gives both sides
|extended access to profile information, unless you make use of the
|<b> /trust </b> command to specify a custom trust level for this person.
|
|<a name="trust"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /trust &lt;Name&gt; &lt;Digit&gt;|- </B></p></dd>
|Define a custom trust level value for a person. The trust level must
|be a digit ranging from 0 to 9, or a minus character, which will restore
|the default.
|
|<a name="expose"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /expose &lt;Name&gt; &lt;Digit&gt;|- </B></p></dd>
|Define the exposure level for a friend. This factor defines how high the

|where State is one out of
|<b>realtime, talkative, here, busy, nearby, unavailable, away, vacation, offline</b>
|while Description is an optional
|free form phrase to describe your state better.
|As soon as you enter this, your change of state and description will
|be multicast to all your friends.
|
|<DT><P><b> /av(ailability) &lt;Digit&gt; [&lt;Description&gt;] </b></p><dd>
|You can achieve the same also by providing the state numerically.

|<nobr>"<b>/set home &lt;roomName&gt;</b>"</nobr>.
|
|<a name="clearscreen"></a>
|<DT><P><B> &lt;ENTER&gt; </B></p><dd>
|Transmitting an empty line simply by hitting ENTER or RETURN

|<DT><P><B> /unsub(scribe) &lt;room&gt; </B></p><dd>
|does what you expect.
|
|</dl>
|{_HTML_info_split}
|
|<h5>JUST A LITTLE HISTORY LESSON..</h5>
|<dl>
|
|<a name="msg"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /m(sg) &lt;name&gt; &lt;message&gt; </B></p><dd>
|is the same as <b>/tell</b>, for compatibility to IRC.
|The command was originally introduced on IBM mainframes to
|send a message to an other user, then adapted to work
|across the BITnet/EARN.
|
|<a name="whois"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /whois &lt;name&gt; </B></p><dd>
|is the BITnet Relay equivalent for <b>/examine</b> and <b>/x</b>.
|
|<a name="part"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /part &lt;room&gt; </B></p><dd>
|is the IRC equivalent to <b>/leave</b>.
|
|<a name="change"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /c(hange) &lt;room&gt; </B></p><dd>
|works like <b>/go</b>. The command on BITnet relay was actually
|<b>/channel</b> and the channels were numeric like on HAM radio.
|## Jeff Kell probably came up with that analogy.
|
|<a name="query"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /q(uery) [&lt;person&gt;] </B></p><dd>
|is the same as <b>/talk</b>, for compatibility to IRC.
|Jarkko Oikarinen is probably the person who came
|up with this terminus, as if one would always be asking questions.
|
|<a name="lastlog"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /la(stlog) [&lt;amount or pattern&gt;] </B></p><dd>
|is the same as <b>/log</b>, for compatibility to ircII.
|BigCheese introduced this function in 1989.
|
|<a name="mudemote"></a>
|<DT><P><B> :&lt;description&gt; </B></p><dd>
|works just like <b>/me</b>.
|This notation comes from the world of multi-user adventure games,
|supposedly around 1987. lynX liked it so much, that he introduced it
|in IRC in form of the <b>/me</b> command in 1990.
|You can change the colon character using <b>/set actchar</b>.
|
|</dl>
|{_HTML_info_split}
|
|<h5>FURTHER EXOTIC COMMANDS..</h5>
|<dl>
|
|<dt><p><a name="uptime"><b> /up(time) </b></a></p><dd>
|How long has this been going on?
|
|<dt><p><a name="version"><b> /vers(ion) [ &lt;person&gt; ] </b></a></p><dd>
|Information request about the software version of your server or somebody
|else's software configuration, which may or may not be given to you however.
|
|<a name="notify"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /notify &lt;person&gt; [&lt;delay&gt;] </B></p><dd>
|does the opposite of what IRC <b>/notify</b> does: it actively
|sends presence notification to the person. This is a sort of
|"asymmetric" friendship function. You can provide a delay flag
|which is currently one out of <b>[ d(elayed) | D(elayed more) ]</b>,
|this will postpone the presence notification for a certain time
|period after the start of your new session. <b>/nf</b> also allows
|you to delete the notifications to a friend (established using <b>/friend</b>)
|without effectively deleting the friendship.
|
|<a name="save"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /save </B></p><dd>
|is for paranoids only.
|
|<a name="enter"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /enter &lt;room&gt; </B></p><dd>
|is just the nicer name for the <b>/join</b> command.
|
|</dl>

_PAGES_help_remote
|<h5>COMMUNICATION WITH REMOTE PSYC USERS</h5>
|
|The PSYC technology is intended to let you communicate with other
|PSYC users worldwide. In some cases you will already have done so
|without noticing, because some rooms you have entered are connected
|to other PSYC servers, or the people contained in a room may have
|come from a distant server.<p>
|
|You can do these kind of things yourself, using the same commands
|described in the rest of the manual. Whenever a &lt;name&gt; is given
|for a command, you may as well use a PSYC address.<p>
|
|For instance,
|if you want to talk to me, no matter where your server is, you can
|do <b>/t psyc://psyced.org/~lynX</b> (t as in talk).<p>
|
|If you want to enter the PSYC
|developers room, you can go for <b>/c psyc://psyced.org/@welcome</b>
|(c as in change, but you can aswell use /go or even /join).<p>
|
|If you want to flaunt your PSYC address on your business card or email
|signature, you can figure it out using the <b>/x</b> command,
|which examines yourself.<p>
|
|<a name="friend"></a>
|You can make <b>/friend</b>-ships with
|remote users, <b>/subscribe</b> services across the network, and
|you can even do many of these things with <em>Jabber</em>&trade; addresses. Just
|prepend <b>xmpp:</b> to the simplistic User@Host syntax they use.<p>
|
|There are some more commands which are mostly designed for use
|with remote PSYC addresses. Here they are:
|
|<dl>
|<a name="alias"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /alias &lt;nickname&gt; &lt;identity&gt; </B></p><dd>
|allows you to define personal shortcuts for remote PSYC users so you no longer
|have to type the complete address. Makes the person also more palpable
|to your IRC client, if you are using one.
|
|<a name="unalias"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /unalias &lt;nickname&gt; </B></p><dd>
|Do I need to explain this one?
|
|<a name="surf"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /surf </B></p><dd>
|produces a web address where you can head off surfing along the social
|network of your friends friends. You must give this a try!
|
|<a name="connect"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /co(nnect) &lt;identity&gt; [&lt;password&gt;] </B></p><dd>
|Experimental command to switch personality or even connect to a
|PSYC identity on a remote PSYC server.
|</dl>

_PAGES_help_access

_PAGES_help_room
|<h5>ROOM-ORIENTED FUNCTIONS</h5>
|
|Rooms are programmable in <a target=PSYC href="http://www.psyc.eu">PSYC</a>.
|<b>psyced</b> in particular provides the administrator with standard
|components which can still be enhanced with custom logic and commands.
|In fact commands are being added all the time, and even you could help us
|implement anything we haven't provided yet.
|These are the commands provided by such standard components, leaving out
|only the new <b>THREADS</b> rooms, also known as forum/blog-rooms, which
|are easier to use via the web interface anyway.
|<dl>
|
|<dt><h5>INVITE AND FOLLOW</h5>
|<a name="invite"></a>
|<p><b> /i(nvite) [&lt;person&gt;] </b></p><dd>
|Invite a person into this room. The room will be informed of this,
|so it can decide wether to let the person in, which is the normal
|behaviour. It may also choose to inform the others of your
|invitation.
|
|<a name="follow"></a>
|<p><b> /f(ollow) </b></p><dd>
|The recipient of an invitation just needs to type <b>/f</b> as in
|<b>/follow</b> to enter the room. If there was no invitation, then
|the last active room is selected.
|
|<dt><h5>BASIC FUNCTIONS</h5>
|<a name="topic"></a>
|<dt><p><b> /top(ic) [&lt;topicAnnouncement&gt;] </b></p><dd>
|sets a persistent description of the discussion topic.
|This command may be reserved for administrators or owners in public rooms.
|
|<a name="status"></a>
|<dt><p><b> /st(atus) </b> or the short form <b> /s </b></p><dd>
|shows information about the room.
|
|<dt><h5>w/ HISTORY COMPONENT</h5>
|<a name="history"></a>
|<p><b> /hist(ory) [&lt;amount or pattern&gt;] </b></p><dd>
|shows the given amount of messages from the history of last public
|messages in the room, or it matches them for a pattern you provide.
|This function is only available in special public rooms.
|
|<a name="histclear"></a>
|<dt><p><b> /histclear [&lt;amount&gt;] </b></p><dd>
|may allow you to clear the history of such a public room, depending on
|the configuration of the room. When you provide an amount, only that
|amount of messages is deleted from the room history, otherwise the
|complete history is removed. Should you by mistake keep a private
|conversation in a public room, this may be of help to protect your
|privacy. It is however much safer to keep private conversations
|in private rooms or messages!
|
|<dt><h5>w/ MASQUERADE COMPONENT</h5>
|<a name="nickname"></a>
|<p><b> /ni(ckname) [&lt;mask&gt;] </b></p><dd> 
|The good ole <b>/nick</b> command allows to change your name
|within the conversation of a specific room. For technical reasons
|of protocol design, IRC clients cannot display these changes.
|
|<dt><h5>w/ OWNERS</h5>
|<a name="mandate"></a>
|<p><b> /mand(ate) [&lt;person&gt;] </b></p><dd> 
|enables the owner of a room to empower other room members
|to additional commands.
|
|<a name="listaides"></a>
|<dt><p><b> /listaides </b></p><dd> 
|show the list of people you have empowered.
|
|<a name="kick"></a>
|<a name="elrid"></a>
|<dt><p><b> /kick [&lt;person&gt;] </b></p><dd> 
|bans a person from the room. This decision cannot be revised until
|either the room or the server are reset, so use it wisely - not for fun.
|
|<a name="style"></a>
|<dt><p><b> /style [&lt;http://&lt;web-address of a CSS file&gt;] </b></p><dd>
|defines a <em>style sheets</em> for the place. Only real cool
|PSYC clients will show it, however.

|<a name="public"></a>
|<dt><p><b> /public [on|off] </b></p><dd>
|Certain room types allow operators to change the visibility
|of the room on the fly. You can check using <b>/people</b>.
|
|<a name="masquerade"></a>
|<dt><p><b> /masq(uerade) [on|off] </b></p><dd>
|allows the operators to activate the masquerading option,
|that is the <b>/nick</b> command mentioned before.
|
|<a name="silence"></a>
|<dt><p><b> /silence [presence|conversation|all|none] </b></p><dd>
|The "presence" filter disables or enables the display of enter and leave
|messages in the room. Very useful in crowded rooms. Whereas the "conversation"
|filter makes the room a non-talking room like you typically need for
|external newsfeeds.
|
|<a name="logging"></a>
|<dt><p><b> /logging [on|off] </b></p><dd>
|starts a transcription of public conversation onto the server
|harddisk. The <b> /status </b> command will show if this
|function is currently activated. It is only available in
|predefined permanent public rooms.

|<h5>OPERATOR COMMANDS</h5>
|
|These commands are available to the administrator of the server. 
|For room-specific operator commands see ROOM FUNCTIONS.
|
|<dl>
|<a name="yell"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /yell &lt;message&gt; </B></P><DD>
|
|Make a server-wide announcement.
|
|<a name="tcp"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /tcp </B></P><DD>
|
|Technical list of currently active TCP connections.
|
|<a name="memory"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /mem(ory) </B></P><DD>
|
|Show current memory statistics. Likely to only look good on telnet.
|
|<a name="malloc"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /malloc </B></P><DD>
|
|Memory allocation statistics. Likely to only look good on telnet.
|
|<a name="odump"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /odump </B></P><DD>
|
|Generate an ugly table of object statistics in /log/objects.dump.
|
|<a name="warn"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /warn &lt;nick&gt; [&lt;message&gt;] </B></P><DD>
|
|Issue a warning to a local user of your server.
|
|<a name="kill"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /kill &lt;nick&gt; [&lt;message&gt;] </B></P><DD>
|
|If the warning didn't impress, disconnect a local user from your server.
|
|<a name="block"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /block &lt;addressMask&gt; &lt;reason&gt; </B></P><DD>
|
|This disables access to the server from Internet address numbers
|which start with &lt;addressMask&gt;. To help you remember why you
|did that, you are requested to store a reason along with it.
|For example you could be issueing:
|<p><b> /block 207.46.130. no microserfs on this server! </b></p>
|It is a good idea to always terminate your masks with a period
|so that 10.10.10 wouldn't match 10.10.103.3.
|Use the same command to unblock a host.
|
|<a name="config"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /config &lt;entry&gt; &lt;setting&gt; [&lt;value&gt;] </B></P><DD>
|
|Configure a setting for a specific entity, usually remote servers.
|But we are currently not using this function to do any job.
|
|<a name="patch"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /patch &lt;nick&gt; &lt;setting&gt; [&lt;value&gt;] </B></P><DD>
|
|This allows to change a setting for a local user, as if the user entered
|a /set command. But in fact this is currently limited to resetting the
|password.
|
|<a name="reload"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /(re)load &lt;file&gt; </B></P><DD>
|
|Recompile an object class. Typically necessary when modifying an existing
|place (<b> /load place/space </b>) without restarting the server.
|
|<a name="destruct"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /destruct &lt;object&gt; </B></P><DD>
|
|Destruct an object or object class without reloading it. Can be abused
|to disconnect a user without a polite message.
|
|<a name="shutdown"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /shutdown </B></P><DD>
|
|Shutdown the server. The actual shutdown happens in several phases and
|takes a few seconds for hopefully all connections to be safely closed.
|
|<a name="restart"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /restart </B></P><DD>
|
|Restart the server.

|<h5>USER SETTINGS</h5>
|
|Most of the following functions can also be changed using the <b>/edit</b>
|command, if you are using the web interface.
|
|<dl>
|
|<a name="password"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /set password &lt;newWord&gt; </B> or<br>
|       <B> /set password &lt;oldWord&gt; &lt;newWord&gt; </B></p><dd>
|register or modify a password. Once a password is set your chat name
|can only be accessed by providing such password.
|
|<a name="email"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /set email &lt;emailAddress&gt; </B></p><dd>
|sets your e-mail address. This information is visible to your <i>friends</i>
|only, and to the server administrator if he necessitates to reach you.
|Best of all, it enables the server to forward messages to you by email when
|you're not online.
|
|<DT><P><B> /set telephone &lt;phoneNumbers&gt; </B></p><dd>
|is a good place to keep phone numbers for your friends to call you.
|
|<DT><P><B> /set home &lt;homeRoom&gt; </B></p><dd>
|sets your "home" room, a room you are sent to when you type <b>/home</b>.
|
|<DT><P><B> /set publicname &lt;Your Name&gt; </B></p><dd>
|shows everybody what your real name is.
|
|<DT><P><B> /set name &lt;yourNickname&gt; </B></p><dd>
|changes the uppercase/lowercase style in which your name should be
|displayed, so you can be sure your name will always appear in the proper
|way even when people type your name in the wrong case.
|
|<DT><P><B> /set speakaction &lt;verb&gt; </B></p><dd>
|lets you speak with a different verb than "says", for instance try
|"whispers" or "yells".
|
|<DT><P><B> /set visiblespeakaction [ on | off | mixed ] </B></p><dd>
|if your IRC client shows actions in a nice way, you may want
|to activate them!
|
|<DT><P><B> /set filter [ s(trangers) | off ] </B></p><dd>
|disables receiving messages from people that are neither your friends
|nor in the same room with you. You can make friends using the rather
|obvious <b>/friend</b> command.
|
|<DT><P><B> /set presencefilter [ on | off | all | automatic ] </B></p><dd>
|helps you limit the choice of friends' presence updates that are shown to you.
|by default, automatic away messages are filtered, whereas other types are
|shown. when this is set to "on", only explicitly manually set away messages
|are shown. by setting this value to "off" you can see any presence message
|while the "all" setting will disable any display of presence messages.
|you can still see who's on or away by looking at your buddy list however.
|
|<DT><P><B> /set echo [ off | on | automatic ] </B></p><dd>
|Normally you will see everything you type echoed to your screen
|so you can be sure they arrived safely. But you may prefer not to
|see such echo. If you're using the IRC access port, then you will
|automatically not receive any echo, since that's uncommon on IRC,
|but you can switch it on explicitedly.
|
|<DT><P><B> /set greeting [ off | on | automatic ] </B></p><dd>
|When you connect to psyced you are shown your last login data
|which is useful for you to ensure nobody else connected to your
|account in the meantime. You are also informed about your current
|command character and a few other things. You can turn this greeting
|information off using this setting. If you're a Jabber user, then these
|greetings will be off by default, as it is unusual behaviour for Jabber
|servers. In that case you may want to intentionally turn them on to
|improve your safety.
|
|## <DT><P><B> /set multiplace [ on | off ] </B></p><dd>
|## allows you to enter more than one room at a time in some access forms.
|## An essential feature for advanced users, yet confusing for some beginners.
|## 
|<DT><P><B> /set clearscreen [ on | off ] </B></p><dd>
|only applies to the telnet access. Hitting carriage return without
|any other input will normally clear the terminal screen.
|
|<DT><P><B> /set visibility [ off | on ] </B></p><dd>
|makes you invisible from <b>/who</b> or <b>/people</b> commands.
|
|<DT><P><B> /set exposetime [ off | on ] </B></p><dd>
|hides the information when you were last active also from your friends.
|
|</dl>
|{_HTML_info_split}
|<dl>
|
|<DT><P><B> /set publicpage http://&lt;web-address&gt; </B></p><dd>
|lets you publish your homepage address. It appears whenever someone
|clicks on your name.
|
|<DT><P><B> /set privatepage http://&lt;web-address&gt; </B></p><dd>
|allows you to set up a page just for your chat friends. It will not
|be shown to chatters that haven't exchanged <b>/friend</b>-ship
|with you.
|
|<DT><P><B> /set photopage http://&lt;web-address&gt; </B></p><dd>
|A page that shows more photos of you. Will be linked to your
|profile photo.
|
|<DT><P><B> /set photofile http://&lt;web-address&gt; </B></p><dd>
|A medium size photo of yours, stored on a web server of your choice.
|The photo appears when you or your friends use <b>/surf</b> to look
|at your profile.
|
|<DT><P><B> /set miniphotofile http://&lt;web-address&gt; </B></p><dd>
|A thumbnail size photo of yours, to be used for lists of friends.
|
|<DT><P><B> /set keyfile http://&lt;web-address&gt; </B></p><dd>
|invites you to store the address of your public key file,
|allowing for encrypted communication to happen between you and
|your friends, provided you are both using an encryption capable
|<a target=psyc href="http://www.psyc.eu">PSYC</a> client,
|or at least email.
|
|<DT><P><B> /set stylefile http://&lt;web-address&gt; </B></p><dd>
|lets you specify a cascading style sheet file for personalized
|presentation of your profile!
|
|</dl>
|{_HTML_info_split}
|<dl>
|
|<DT><P><B> /set commandcharacter &lt;prefix&gt; </B></p><dd>
|Also accepted as <b>cmdchar</b> this setting allows you to change
|the character that prefixes commands. The cmdchar normally is
|set to <b>/</b> (slash) except for IRC users, for them it is
|a <b>+</b> (plus sign) by default.
|
|<DT><P><B> /set actioncharacter [ &lt;prefix&gt; | off ] </B></p><dd>
|Also understood as <b>actchar</b> this setting allows you to change
|or even disable the character that prefixes actions. The actchar normally
|is set to <b>:</b> (colon). You can also produce actions by issuing my
|popular <b>/me</b> command.
|
|<DT><P><B> /set charset [ &lt;character-set&gt; | - ] </B></p><dd>
|Some access technologies (telnet, applet, IRC) may need you to set the
|client's character set manually. If your umlauts look all wrong, try
|<b>/set charset latin1</b>. This setting will have no influence on
|other access technologies.
|The system charset on this server is {_VAR_charset}.
|
|<a name="timestamp"></a>
|<DT><P><B> /set timestamp [ on | off | - ] </B></p><dd>
|The normal behaviour is to show timestamps with messages that did not
|happen "just now." When turned "on," IRC clients will receive CTCP
|TS messages instead of plain text timestamps.
|
|## <DT><P><B> /set verbatimuniform [ on | off ] </B></p><dd>
|## If you run a very polite IRC client, you may find this useful. It
|## stops patching addresses of remote users. But it's even better to
|## use the <b>/alias</b> command.
|##
