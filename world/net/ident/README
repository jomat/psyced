server.c - receives ident connections and answers them
master.c - holds the connection data and provides an api to it
ident.h  - defines for the ident system

usage:
 * include ident.h
 * register new connections:
   put this i. e. to logon()
   IDENT_MASTER->update_connection(server->port,server->owner,query_mud_port(this_object()));
   not directly after net_connect() because query_mud_port() won't answer the correct
   port if the connection isn't established yet
