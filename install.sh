Now comes the best part. You get to decide which of the many protocols and
services that psyced provides you want to activate. Since ${driver} doesn't
have the ability to run safely as root, all protocols use non-privileged
port numbers. We also mention the official privileged port numbers in case
you want to set up a firewall based port mapping.

If you need to change the port numbers later on, you can do so by editing
the psyconf.ini configuration file.
